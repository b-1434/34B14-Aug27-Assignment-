#Program of all 5 arithematic operations 


a = int(input("Enter the value of a : "))
b = int(input("Enter the value of b : "))

# Addition of numbers
add = a + b

# Subtraction of numbers
sub = a - b

# Multiplication of number
mul = a * b

# Division of number
div = a / b

# Modulo of both number
mod = a % b

# print results
print("Addition of two numbers is ",add)
print("Subtraction of two numbers is ",sub)
print("Multiplication of two numbers is ",mul)
print("Division of two numbers is ",div)
print("Modulos of two numbers is ",mod)

Output:-

Enter the value of a : 10
Enter the value of b : 20
Addition of two numbers is  30
Subtraction of two numbers is  -10
Multiplication of two numbers is  200
Division of two numbers is  0.5
Modulos of two numbers is  10
